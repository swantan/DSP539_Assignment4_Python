# DSP539_Assignment4_Python

## Aim
To generate linguistic complexity for a short string (sampleseq.fasta) and also each sequence in nd2.fasta.

## Input file
sampleseq.fasta
nd2.fasta

## Approach
> 1. Create a Seq object that accepts a DNA sequence (a string). =DONE=
> 2. Add a method to count kmers of size k, where k is specified as a argument. =DONE=
3. Add a method to create a pandas data frame containing all possible k and the associated number of observed and expected kmers (see above table).
4. Add a method to produce a graph from the data frame of the proportion of each kmer observed.
5. Add a method to calculate linguistic complexity.
6. Write a script to thoroughly test each of your functions.
>7. Use the main function to read in your sequence data and output results. =DONE=
> 8. Create a github repository including a README (in markdown) to submit your work. =DONE=
